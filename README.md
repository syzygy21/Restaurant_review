# Restaurant_review
 I worked on this project to get insights into how Natural Language Processing is used. This project consists of a naive bayes model that was trained on a bag of words model created throgh a dataset consisting of positive and negative reviews for a restaurant. After training the model could further predict whether if a future review would be positive or negative. Below is a link to the ipynb notebook within this repo. Scrolling to the bottom of the notebook and looking at the code gives an idea that after a little bit of pre-processing of the inputted review and feeding it into the model will spit whether if the review is positive or negative in terms 1 or 0 respectively.
